# ReactNativeFirebaseStack
A React Native app using firebase as the backend. Moved away from expo in response when needing turn images into blob files and upload them to Firebase storage, as this was a limitation that expo couldn't handle properly.

Have a ios emulator from xcode or an android emulator from android studio.

Installing node modules, 'npm install',  'yarn install'.

Run the server from command line 'npm start'/'yarn start'.
